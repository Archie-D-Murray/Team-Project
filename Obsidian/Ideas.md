### Base System
- Top down
- Pixel art
- 2D

### Input System
- WASD to move
- Mouse to aim?
- Do we want to **take inspiration** of the idea of 'programmer' animations from something like [ARCHVALE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2KA2YvYlNM)? (Could create a generic 'item' animation that could be overridden...)
- TAB for stats?

### Character Controller
- Acceleration + drag (will require tuning) or set velocity (easy but limited later) movement
- Dash?
- Other Movement abilities?
- Mouse interactions?

### Enemies
- Probably should have some

### Bosses
- These are pretty good too

### Spell System
- Fantasy based elements (Fire, Ice, Wind, Earth) - may want to limit number
- Could have unique interactions (such as spawning an object) based on element with each other (wind + fire -> creates explosion (damage + knockback), wind + ice -> creates storm that does some DoT effect + a slow)
- Could swap out a list of available spells or upgrade existing (want to pick one as otherwise it will be awful to manage)
